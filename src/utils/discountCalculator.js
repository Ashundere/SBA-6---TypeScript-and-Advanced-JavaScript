//Discount Calculator Module (discountCalculator.ts):
//Create a calculateDiscount() function to handle discount calculations for products.
//This function should return the dollar amount that a product is discounted by. For example, if a product costs $100 and has a 10% discount, the function should return $10.
export const calculateDiscount = (discountPercentage, total) => {
    return ((discountPercentage * total) / 100);
};
